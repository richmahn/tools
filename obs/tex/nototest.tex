% Using multi language text with Noto fonts.

% First we define the fallbacks,
\definefallbackfamily [noto][ss] [NotoSansEthiopic] [range=ethiopic,scale=1.2]
\definefallbackfamily [noto][ss] [NotoSansArmenian] [range=armenian] 
\definefallbackfamily [noto][ss] [NotoNaskhArabic] [range=arabic,scale=1.2]
% then the main font family,
\definefontfamily     [noto] [ss][NotoSans] 
% and finaly we activate this package.
\setupbodyfont[noto] 

\starttext
Testing, testing, just some standard Latin script options: língua portuguesa, português

Here is some Ethiopic (the defined fallback should switch to Amharic without extra coding in this source text): አማርኛ

And this is Russian (since cyrillic is already in NotoSans by default, no fallback is defined to handle this): ру́сский язы́к

Here is Amenian (with NotoSansArmenian): հայերեն 

And here is some Arabic (using NotoNaskhArabic):  العَرَبِيةُ‎‎

The end.
